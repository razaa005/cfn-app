I went to the kitchen to grab a knife and I just plunged it into his chest and ran.&quot;</p><p>Miller will be sentenced on Wednesday.</p><p><em>Follow BBC Wiltshire on </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCRadioWiltshire"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCWiltshire"><em>X</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwiltshire/"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>.

      </figure><p>A construction company was fined £100,000 after a worker was seriously injured when a wall collapsed onto him.</p><p>Matrod Frampton Limited was working at the site in Old Coastguard Road in Poole in August 2022 when the 69-year-old steel-fixer was left with life-changing injuries.</p><p>A breezeblock wall was backfilled too early and before its mortar had properly set and it collapsed as he was working nearby, crushing him against a concrete floor.</p><p>The company, of Riverside Park, Wimborne, admitted breaching health and safety regulations at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 5 December, was fined and told to pay a further £8,242 in costs and a £2,000 victim surcharge.</p><p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the company had not properly assessed the site's risks and that it had failed to appoint a coordinator or supervisor for work. </p><p>That had been highlighted as a risk in a safety report eight days before the accident happened.</p><p>An HSE inspector, Alexander Ashen, said: &quot;The correct design and execution of temporary works is an essential element of risk prevention in construction.</p><p>&quot;This incident illustrates what can happen when temporary works are not properly organised. Matrod Frampton Limited is an established construction company, and a temporary works procedure should have been implemented as a matter of course,&quot; he added.</p><p>&quot;The fact that the company's own health and safety consultants raised this issue eight days before the incident makes this wholly avoidable event all the more tragic.</p><p>&quot;HSE will not hesitate to take action against companies that fail to properly plan and manage serious risks on construction sites.&quot;</p><p><em>You can follow </em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/dorset"><em>BBC Dorset</em></a><em> on </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcdorset/"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcdorset"><em>X (Twitter)</em></a><em>, or </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcdorset"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>

Police believe she was struck by a van on nearby Old Park Lane.</p><p>Mr Azim appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday and Judge Michael Chambers KC delayed his plea and trial preparation hearing to January 16.</p><p>A trial, expected to last at least two weeks, was provisionally set for June 1 despite a request from prosecutors to put it back a day because it would have been Ms Whitehouse's birthday.</p><p>The court heard Mr Azim, who was born in Pakistan but came to England when he was 16, had limited English and would require a Mirpuri interpreter for future court hearings.</p><p>He was not asked to enter any pleas during Tuesday's hearing and was told he would remain in custody.</p><p>In a tribute released through West Midlands Police after her death, Ms Whitehouse's family previously said Lily's laughter could light up the world.</p><p>&quot;You were so special.

      </figure><p>A Liberal Democrat peer disqualified from driving for the second time this year has said it was the best result he could have received.</p><p>Lord Tim Razzall admitted passing a red light and was handed a two-week discretionary disqualification at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier.</p><p>The 82-year-old, of Notting Hill, west London, was driving a Volkswagen Polo at the junction between Grosvenor Road and Chelsea Bridge Road, west London, on 13 March.</p><p>He said there had been heavy traffic on the Embankment and in such conditions &quot;you don't necessarily react quickly enough to the light&quot;. In July he was disqualified for the same amount of time for speeding.</p><p>When asked to stand and enter his plea, the Lib Dems' former treasurer said: &quot;Well I'm clearly guilty, yeah.&quot;</p><p>Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told Lord Razzall, who had no legal representation, that he would have received 14 days' disqualification in total for both offences if they had been dealt with together.</p><p>&quot;So in effect Mr Razzall is, in a way, getting an extra 14 days' disqualification,&quot; he added.</p><p>Near the end of the hearing, Lord Razzall, said: &quot;I'm just glad there is no press in the courtroom, unlike last time.&quot;</p><p>The chief magistrate looked towards the public gallery and said: &quot;I think there is.&quot;</p><p>Before getting into a black cab, Lord Razzall told reporters: &quot;It is slightly unfortunate that had this been taken into account before then I would not have been disqualified again.&quot;</p><p>Asked if he was pleased with the result, he said: &quot;Well it's the best I could have, yeah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was very heavy traffic, heavier than this,&quot; he said while gesturing to Marylebone Road outside the court.</p><p>&quot;It's quite hard along the Embankment, you often, with heavy traffic, you know, you don't necessarily react quickly enough to the light.&quot;</p><p>He added: &quot;I suspect I was driving to Holland Park along the Embankment.&quot;</p><p>Lord Razzall was ordered to pay £410 which includes a £200 fine.</p><p><em>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on </em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/curation/p0cjdwm5"><em>Sounds</em></a><em> and follow BBC London on </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLondon"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews"><em>X</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclondon/?hl=en"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>.
